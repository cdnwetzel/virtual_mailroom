# OCR File Number Extraction Issues Analysis

## Date: 2025-09-25

### Issue 1: L2501529 Truncated to L2501
**Problem**: File number L2501529 was only partially extracted as L2501

**Likely Causes**:
1. **OCR Artifacts**: The "529" portion may have visual artifacts (lines, smudges) causing OCR to treat them as separate characters or stop reading
2. **Character Spacing**: If there's unusual spacing between "1" and "5", the regex word boundary `\b` might break the match
3. **Pattern Mismatch**: The regex `([A-Z]{0,2}\d{1,8})` should capture this, but post-processing might truncate

**Current Code Behavior**:
- pdf_splitter.py: Pattern `([A-Z]{0,2}\d{1,8})` allows up to 2 letters + up to 8 digits
- Length check: `if len(file_number) <= 8` (L2501529 = 8 chars, should pass)
- fast_ocr_extractor.py: Pattern `\b([A-Z]\d{7})\b` expects exactly 1 letter + 7 digits

### Issue 2: J2500072 Not Detected
**Problem**: File number J2500072 failed to extract completely

**Likely Causes**:
1. **Character Misrecognition**:
   - 'J' might be read as '3', 'I', or other similar character
   - OCR replacements convert 'I' â†’ '1', which could interfere
2. **Missing Prefix Recognition**: OCR might not properly read "Our File Number:" label
3. **Clean Scan Paradox**: Sometimes very clean scans can cause issues if contrast is too low

**Current Code Behavior**:
- Both J2500072 (8 chars) should match patterns
- Character replacements in fast_ocr might be too aggressive

## Potential Improvements (Not Implemented)

### 1. Enhanced Pattern Flexibility
```python
# More flexible patterns for edge cases
r'Our File Number:?\s*([A-Z]{0,2}\d{6,8})'  # Allow 6-8 digits
r'File\s*(?:Number|No|#):?\s*([A-Z]{0,2}\d{6,8})'  # Multiple variations
```

### 2. Better OCR Preprocessing
```python
# Enhance contrast for clean scans
# Apply adaptive thresholding for artifacts
# Use multiple OCR passes with different settings
```

### 3. Validation Improvements
```python
# Check for common truncation points
# If file number ends at round number (like 2501), look ahead for more digits
# Validate against known file number formats (J + 7 digits, L + 7 digits)
```

### 4. Character Confusion Handling
```python
# More careful character replacements
# Context-aware replacements (J at start of file number shouldn't become 1)
# Try multiple interpretations if first attempt fails
```

## Observed Patterns
- NY file numbers typically: J or L + 7 digits (8 total)
- NJ file numbers typically: Various formats
- Truncation often happens at visually "complete" numbers (2501 looks complete)
- Clean scans sometimes harder than slightly noisy ones

## Testing Recommendations
1. Create test cases with known problem file numbers
2. Test with various scan qualities
3. Log OCR raw output before replacements for debugging
4. Consider confidence scores for OCR results
